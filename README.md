# Hello world Couchapp, with Bootstrap!
https://github.com/Smileupps/couchapp-hello-world

## Purpose 
This couchapp shows how to serve static websites directly from CouchDB, using the *_attachments* field/folder of CouchDB design documents. All files and folders contained within *_attachments* may be served as static HTTP resources from your own domain, by simply wiring them using two simple rewriting rules (*rewrites field*).
