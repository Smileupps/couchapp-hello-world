# Hello world Couchapp, with Bootstrap! 
https://github.com/Smileupps/couchapp-hello-world

This couchapp shows how the *_attachments* field of CouchDB design documents, can be used to serve static websites directly from CouchDB. All files and folders within the *_attachments* can be served as static HTTP resources, by simply wiring them using two simple rewriting rules (*rewrites field*).

This app is part of Smileupps CouchDB Examples and is delivered within the [Smileupps CouchDB Hosting application](https://www.smileupps.com/store/apps/couchdb). Otherwise you can download this repository to your local disk, and then upload it to your own CouchDB instance using the [Smileupps Couch OS app](https://github.com/Smileupps/couchos) or a [CouchDB deployment tool](https://www.smileupps.com/wiki).
